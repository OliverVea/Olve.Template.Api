# Frontend gate: Biome lint/format + Vitest unit suite + the production build for the SPA
# in frontend/. Runs as a production step in PARALLEL with build-and-package and code-test
# (not inside them), in a Node image — the dotnet SDK image that code-test uses has no Node.
# A failure here fails the production job group, which gates the whole processing cascade
# (deploy never runs) — exactly like the .NET unit suite. Produces no deploy artifacts (no
# version.txt), so the deploy scripts ignore its bundle dir.
#
# DELETE-WITH-THE-FRONTEND: this step exists solely for the frontend/ folder — there is no
# template toggle. A headless microservice that deletes frontend/ must also delete THIS
# script and the `frontend-check` step in config.yaml. Keep both as one removable unit.
#
# Runs on node:24-alpine: busybox wget + tar (needed by olve_fetch_repo) and npm are built
# in, and package-lock.json carries the musl platform binaries for Biome and rolldown
# (Vite/Vitest), so `npm ci` resolves them. Validated against the alpine image before commit.
