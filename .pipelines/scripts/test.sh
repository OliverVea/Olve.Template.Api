# Run the unit test suite as a production step in PARALLEL with build-and-package — not
# inside the Docker build, so tests and image build run concurrently instead of serialized.
# A failure here fails the production job group, which gates the whole processing cascade
# (deploy never runs).
#
# Code comes from the GitHub tarball, the same way build.sh fetches it (the runner has no
# git checkout). The tarball is `git archive`-equivalent: source only, no .git dir — so
# tests must not depend on .git to locate the repo root.
